.SH NAME
majacd \- console CD player
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "majacd " " [" \-V "] ["\-s "] ["\-n "] [" \-d " <device>] ["
.I <command>
.RB "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBmajacd\fP is a simple console CD player application that allows for
playing CD audio disks on any device connected to the sound card.  It cannot
"grab" the tracks (aka digital playback).  If you do not have the CD device audio
output connected to the sound card you need some other application.

Without the \fB\-n\fP or \fB\-d\fP options specified the application attempts to
detect the device automatically and sends the specified command to the first
device containing a CD audio disc detected.  Upon successful command completion
the application exits unless it was started in the slave mode.
